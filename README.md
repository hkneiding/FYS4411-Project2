#### FYS4411 - Computational Physics II: Quantum Mechanical Systems 
##### Project 2: Restricted Boltzmann Machines applied to the Quantum many-body Problem

A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) approach has been developed to determine ground state energies of confined Bose systems with different numbers of particles and dimensions. Brute-force and importance Metropolist-Hastings sampling have been implemented as well as Gibbs sampling. A non-interacting as well as an interacting system have been examined. Optimization of network parameters has been done using the stochastic gradient descent method. The results have been evaluated using the statistical method of blocking.
